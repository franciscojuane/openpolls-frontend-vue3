# OpenPolls Frontend (Vue 3 version)

## Description

The OpenPolls Frontend is a user-friendly web application built with Vue 3, Vuetify, and Vuex, designed to provide an intuitive interface for creating, managing, and responding to polls. It seamlessly integrates with the OpenPolls Backend to deliver a complete polling system.

## Key Features

- Poll Creation and Management: Easily create, edit, and delete polls with a clean and responsive UI.

- Poll Responses: Users can submit responses to polls, with options to limit submissions by IP or email to prevent duplicate entries.

- Results Visualization: View poll results in real-time through charts or by getting raw data.

- Role-Based Access Control: A permissions system ensures that users can only access features based on their assigned roles (e.g., admin, editor, viewer).

## Technologies Used

- Vue 3: Progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.

- Vuetify: Material Design component framework for Vue.js.

- Vuex: State management library for Vue.js.
